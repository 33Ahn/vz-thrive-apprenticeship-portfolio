## Project #1: movie-api
Give a high-level overview of the project purpose

✅ Describe the application and why you created this program

    -- The purpose of the project was to create a movie API that allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and manage their movie watchlist. This project was part of the Frontend module and aimed to familiarize ourselves with API usage.

✅ Describe the overall structure of your application and the design process prior to building the program

    -- Before building the program, the overall structure of the application was planned and designed. This involved determining which movie data API sites we would use, API endpoints based on what we want to show, and user interface components. Wireframes were created to visualize the application's layout and functionality.

✅ Explain the code you wrote to achieve your desired result

    -- To achieve the desired result, I initialized the application using a JavaScript library, React, to build the user interface components, including search box, movie cards, navigation, and movie details.

    -- Also, deployed the application on Netlify to  be accessible to users from anywhere, providing them with a platform to interact with the application and experience its functionalities

✅ Showcase your final application with its functionality

    -- The final application showcased full functionality, allowing users to search for movies by title, view detailed information about each movie, and add movies to their watchlist. The user interface provided an intuitive and user friendly experience, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the application.

✅ JOB FUNCTION 2: Take a business or user problem, gather data to analyze the problem, and
                use prototyping tools to create a high fidelity wireframe and UI framework, test the application, and use agile project management
## Competencies
✨ JF 2.4 Can create simple software designs to effectively communicate understanding of the program

  -- The project started with wireframes that were created by our team, outlining the desired layout and functionality of the application. To effectively translate these wireframes into user interfaces, I began by analyzing each wireframe and breaking it down into its core components, and communicated with our team to share our thoughts and ideas.

✨ JF 2.6 Can translate wireframes into User Interfaces

  -- Once the software design was complete, I began implementing the user interfaces based on the design using React. I utilized JSX syntax, CSS styling, and JavaScript to build the necessary components, ensuring they closely matched the wireframes that our team created.


✅ JOB FUNCTION 4: Manage and deploy applications and programs, conduct testing,        and adhere to industry security standards

✨ JF 4.3 Is able to build, manage and deploy code into the relevant environment

    --  Upon opening an account on Netlify, I proceeded to deploy a React application to a live server. This involved configuring the necessary settings and connecting the application to the Netlify platform.

    -- By leveraging the features provided by Netlify, I was able to seamlessly deploy the React application to a live server environment.

    -- The deployment process involved uploading the codebase to Netlify, configuring build settings, and triggering the deployment process. Netlify handled the build and deployment tasks, ensuring that the application was properly built and optimized for production.
