# J.A.B 
Welcome to 'Just A Blog', a MERN  fullstack project containing a user use case
and also an admin use case(coming soon feature).


## Situation

J.A.B is a deployed, full stack application, where the main idea is that users can create posts, upload images, view other users posts and modify their posts.
As title suggests... it's "just a blog"ðŸ˜‰ 


## Task

The project fulfill Job function 1 through 6 as a fullstack app, using MERN stack.
The folder structure contains 4 main parts:

- JF 1.5	Can work effectively and contribute appropriately on a team to produce software
- JF 1.6	Can follow software designs and functional/technical specifications				
- JF 1.7	Can follow company, team or client approaches to continuous integration, version and source control
- JF 2.3	Can develop effective user interfaces				
- JF 2.4	Can create simple software designs to effectively communicate understanding of the program

## Action

 I served as both frontend and backend developer and played a key role in designing the application's user interface and overall user experience, aiming to develop a user-friendly web application with features like image uploading, ability for a user to 'login/register', create-read-update-delete a post as a user.
 Throughout the project, my colleague(Bryan) and I worked together as a pair, ensuring constant communication and code review to maintain high coding standards, refactoring where necesary.
 I was responsible for the entire frontend, and regarding the backend I have created the folder structure, established connection to MongoDB database, set up 'posts' schema, 'postController', implemented the 'errorMiddleware'.
 Worked collaborated with Bryan on the backend for 'usersController'.
## Result 

- [J.A.B App](https://blog-client-io30.onrender.com/)

### Appendix

Aditional info regarding the requirements of building the app:


#### Tier 1 â€” MVP Application - UI


- Essential components have been incorporated and laid out on the page.

- User is able to navigate through the page using necessary routes.

- User interface is thoughtfully designed.
- As a user, I want the app to have a nice UX, so that I can be happy and enjoy my time using the app.
- As a user, I want to see the data nicely organized, so that I can consume and interact with it. 

#### Tier 1 - Application MVP Back End

- As a user, I want to read entries from the database

- As a user, I want to add entries to the database

- As a user, I want to delete entries from the database

- As a user, I want to edit entries in the database

- As a user, I expect to do all of the above by accessing RESTful routes

#### Tier 2 - Deployed Application via Continuous Deployment

- Set up continuous deployments so that the application is deployed upon push/merge to main.
- Create a GitHub Workflow file for GitHub Actions and/or other necessary files.

#### Tier 3 - Continuous Integration

- Create a Branch Protection Rule to run the tests upon Pull Requests to the main branch. 

- Upon successful test runs, Github Actions should deploy the application.

#### Tier 4 - Login, Register, and Authentication

- As a user, I can create a new account with my information saved in a database.


- As User B, I should not have access to User Aâ€™s private data (i.e. profile information, unpublished blog posts, private imagesâ€¦)

- Allow only authenticated users to access the private/profile/sharing portion of the application.

- Allow unauthenticated users to access other pages (like a welcome screen, or list of public posts)

#### Tier 5 - Admin vs User & Further Security Implementations

- Create an admin setting that gives different controls to certain users of your application.

- Protect your app against OWASP Top 10.
