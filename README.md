During my apprenticeship program, I had the opportunity to collaborate with several teams, including The Reel Girls, The Wizards Council, Akatsuki-Clan, and The Banana Bunch.

- Your areas of interest:

I have a keen interest in the entire spectrum of software development. Currently, I am particularly focused on exploring the backend aspects. I find myself to topics such as building RESTful APIs, establishing communication between applications, server configurations, and designing the architecture of backend systems. Understanding how these components work together to create robust and efficient backend solutions is an area that captivates my curiosity and drives my learning journey.



## Project #1
Give a high-level overview of the project purpose

- (*Situation*) Describe the application and why you created this program

    -- The purpose of the project was to create a movie API that allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and manage their movie watchlist. The application was developed to provide a convenient platform for movie enthusiasts to discover and track their favorite films.

- (*Task*) Describe the overall structure of your application and the design process prior to building the program

    -- Before building the program, the overall structure of the application was planned and designed. This involved determining the necessary data models, API endpoints, and user interface components. Wireframes were created to visualize the application's layout and functionality.

- (*Action*) Explain the code you wrote to achieve your desired result

    -- To achieve the desired result, I initialized the application using a JavaScript library, React, to build the user interface components, including search box, movie cards, navigation, and watchlist management features.
    -- Also, deployed the application on Netlify to  be accessible to users from anywhere, providing them with a platform to interact with the application and experience its functionalities

- (*Result*) Showcase your final application with its functionality

    -- The final application showcased full functionality, allowing users to search for movies by title, view detailed information about each movie, and add movies to their watchlist. The user interface provided an intuitive and seamless experience, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with the application.

## Competencies

### JF 2.5, JF 2.7
- List the full text of the job function first

JOB FUNCTION 2: Take a business or user problem, gather data to analyze the problem, and
                use prototyping tools to create a high fidelity wireframe and UI framework,
                test the application, and use agile project management

- Describe a situation where you demonstrated this job function.

JF 2.4 Can create simple software designs to effectively communicate understanding of the program

  -- The project started with wireframes that were created by our team, outlining the desired layout and functionality of the application. To effectively translate these wireframes into user interfaces, I began by analyzing each wireframe and breaking it down into its core components, and communicated with our team to share our thoughts and ideas.

JF 2.6 Can translate wireframes into User Interfaces

  -- Once the software design was complete, I began implementing the user interfaces based on the design using React. I utilized JSX syntax, CSS styling, and JavaScript to build the necessary components, ensuring they closely matched the wireframes that our team created. I paid attention to details such as colors, typography, and responsiveness using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

JF 2.7 Effectively manages state for complex User Interfaces
    --


- Summarize the actions you took to accomplish the goal.
    
    -- Understand the Requirements: I started by thoroughly understanding the requirements and objectives of the project. I analyzed and modified the wireframes to gain clarity on the desired user interface and functionality.
    
    -- Design Software Structure: I created a software design that outlined the overall structure and flow of the application. This included identifying the key components, their relationships, and the data flow between them. I used tools like flowcharts to effectively communicate the software design to myself and the team.
   
   -- Implement User Interfaces: Using React, I began implementing the user interfaces based on the software design and wireframes. I converted the wireframes into React components, paying attention to details such as layout, styling, and responsiveness. I leveraged React's component-based architecture to create reusable and modular UI components.
   
   -- Collaborate and Seek Feedback: Throughout the implementation process, I regularly communicated with our team. I shared the software design and demonstrated the progress made in translating wireframes into user interfaces. I actively sought their feedback and incorporated their suggestions into the UI design, making revisions as needed.

- Emphasize the results of this action for your team or your learning.

    -- The actions taken to accomplish the goal of creating effective software designs and translating wireframes into user interfaces using React had significant results for both my team and my personal learning.

For the team:

  -- Enhanced Collaboration: By actively involving weekly meetings in the feedback and approval process, the team achieved better collaboration and alignment on the design objectives. Regular communication and sharing of progress helped to build a shared understanding of the software design and user interface implementation.

  -- Improved Efficiency: Following a systematic approach, such as creating software designs before implementation, allowed for a more organized and efficient development process. The clear software structure and design guidelines provided a roadmap for the team, enabling them to work more effectively and deliver high-quality user interfaces within the specified timeframe.

For my learning:

  -- Expanded Technical Skills: Implementing user interfaces using React provided an opportunity to enhance my technical skills. I gained better understanding in utilizing React components, managing state and props, and leveraging React's ecosystem for efficient UI development.

  -- Design Thinking: The process of translating wireframes into user interfaces allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of design principles and user experience considerations. I learned how to make design decisions that prioritize usability, accessibility, and visual aesthetics.

  -- Effective Communication: Regularly sharing the software design and having meetings with our team improved my communication skills. It taught me how to effectively present and explain my thoughts, as well as incorporate feedback to refine the user interfaces.
